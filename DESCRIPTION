Title: Tools for creating cluster plots, tree plots and dendrograms
    using ggplot.
Description: Most of the cluster in the R packages functions provide
    plot functions for easy plotting of results.  However, it is not
    always easy to extract the underlying data in order to manipulate
    these plots. The ggcluster packages addresses this problem by
    making available a series of methods to extract the plot segment as
    well as data labels available in data frame format. This data can
    then be manipulated or passed to ggplot() for plotting. The package
    supports data extraction for hclust, dendrogram, tree, kmeans and
    Mclust.
